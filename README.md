# machine-learning-in-futures-market
The primary goal is to evaluate the performance of machine learning techniques, including LSTM, transformers, reinforcement learning, and integrated models in the context of electronic futures trading. These techniques have shown great potential for capturing complex patterns, adapting to changing market conditions, and generating highly accurate trading signals. Through a careful comparison with traditional strategies, we aim to reveal the potential benefits and limitations of incorporating machine learning methods into the futures trading space.
